Extra patron attribute needed for Kanopy
----------------------------------------

Whenever a patron logs into an outside service like Kanopy or Hoopla or Lynda.com, that web service talks to our catalog through a connection called SIP2 to verify that the patron has an account and that they are allowed to access their service.  The information that is transmitted across this connection includes some parts of the patron's contact information including the patron's home library.  The problem we have with Kanopy, however, is that, because of the way the receiving end of the Kanopy SIP2 connection is configured, Kanopy cannot determine what the patron's home library is.  Because of this, we need to send the patron's home library through an alternate route.  To make this happen, we've created a new field in the "Permissions" section on a patron's account called "Kanopy (OTTAWA)."

The new "Kanopy (OTTAWA)" permission will have 3 options

- [blank]
- Not allowed
- Allowed (Ottawa Public Library)

These three options will only be available to staff logged in at OTTAWA in order to prevent staff at other libraries from granting permission to access the Ottawa Public Library's Kanopy service to their patrons.

This will affect staff and patrons in two ways:

#. When staff at OTTAWA create a new account for a patron, the patron's "Kanopy (OTTAWA)" permission needs to be set to "Allowed (Ottawa Public Library)" if their home library is OTTAWA or "Not allowed" if their home library is not OTTAWA.  This should happen automatically when a new patron is created.
#. If staff at another library change a patron's home library, staff at OTTAWA will need to update the patron's "Kanopy (OTTAWA)" settings to "Allowed (Ottawa Public Library)" if the patron's new home library is OTTAWA or"Not allowed" if the patron's new home library is no longer OTTAWA.  This process cannot happen automatically because only OTTAWA staff have access to the "Kanopy (OTTAWA)" permission settings.  Reports will be set up to help OTTAWA staff manage this process.

Creating a new account
----------------------

When logged in at Ottawa Public Library, click on "Patrons"

Then click on the appropriate category on the "New patron" button

Then go through your normal process for creating a new patron

.. image:: ../../images/kanopy.ottawa.030.png

By default, the patron's home library should be set to OTTAWA and the patron's "Kanopy (OTTAWA)" permission should, by default, be set to "Allowed (Ottawa Public Library)"

If you change the patron's home library from to anything besides OTTAWA, the "Kanopy (OTTAWA)" permission should automatically switch to "Not allowed"

However, if you chage a patron's "Kanopy (OTTAWA)" permission manually, the patron's home library will not update automatically.

OTTAWA patrons without Kanopy access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a new patron with a OTTAWA home library is added at a library not logged in as OTTAWA, the new patron's "Kanopy (OTTAWA)" settings will be left blank and the patron will not be able to access Kanopy.  In order to identify these patrons, staff at OTTAWA will need to regularly run report 3298.

Non-OTTAWA patrons with Kanopy access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If an existing patron who has Kanopy access changes their home library, that patron's Kanopy access needs to be removed from their account manually.  If the change to their account happens and staff is not logged in at OTTAWA, staff will not be able to remove the "Kanopy (OTTAWA)" status.  In order to identify these patrons, staff at OTTAWA will need to regularly run report 3299.
